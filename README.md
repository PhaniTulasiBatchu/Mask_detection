# Mask_detection
Its named “IOT living“.
I’ve developed a mask detecting algorithm which detects the presence of a mask on a person’s face when he comes into the camera frame. 
Using this we are going to  control an automated door or a gate at public places.
Process happening is that, camera first detects the person’s face and identifies if he/she is wearing a mask or not, if the person is wearing a mask, a voice saying ’YOU CAN ENTER INSIDE’ will be heard and the door opens for him.
If that person is not wearing a mask then a warning comes saying ‘PLEASE WEAR A MASK AND ENTER’ and the door will stay shut.
Social-distancing is one of the important thing that needs to be focused to prevent the spread.
